# LS-SVM-on-Toy-Dataset
Implemented Least-Squares SVM on Toy Dataset by hand, comparing it to svm library. Then observing how change parameters affect training errors, test errors, and contour plots. 

Download the training and test csv files, and then run the jupyter notebook to see nice contour plots!
